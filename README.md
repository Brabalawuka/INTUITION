# HAPPENING [What's going on?] by 
## It's not a bug, it's a feature
A common problem faced by college students is not knowing what's going on. Try juggling between having a social life, getting good grades and taking enough sleep... yep, you get the idea. We (aka It's not a bug, it's a feature), being college students ourselves, totally feel you and are here to help. What if you could see what's happening around school, on any particular day, without the need of browse through countless emails and text notifications for the nitty gritty event details and long-ass registration links? Maybe, just maybe, the Impossible Trinity of College Education becomes not so impossible after all.
